Here in this project objective was to find the critical insights which would eventually help the business to use there resources more efficiently and identify the areas of improvement.

# Major Insights
Key insights & recommendations:
·       FRIDAY for sure can be crowned as weekly king for grossing highest net values with 16.65% of overall sales.
·       As we often say timing is game changer and it absolutely does for PLATO’s as 11.4% of total orders are made during 12:00-14:00 which we can supposed to be the busiest hours at Plato’s with average orders ranging between 18-20/hour with a footfall range 40-60.
·       17:00-19:00 hours can be mentioned as second wave of rush at PLATO’s which is slightly less in numbers but still accounts for 9.6% of total orders with average orders ranging between 14-16/hour with a footfall range 30-40.
·       During 14:00 to 16:00 hours we notice a drop in order count, we can introduce a concept called Happy Hours during this period and offer some fancy deals which will help in increasing the order count significantly.  
·       On an average 20+ pizza are ordered at Plato’s every hour.
·       The Thai Chicken Pizza is the highest grossing pizza covering almost 5.3% of over-all sales.
·       The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the highest ordered pizza covering 4.9% of total quantity produced.
·       The Brie Carre Pizza is the least ordered pizza with a count of 490  over the span of a year which is less then 2 pizza/day.  
·       Average order value revolves around 16.50 to 17.50 in peak/rush hours where as in low rush hours it could cross 20.00 as well.
·       Large sized pizza are most ordered covering 38.24% of total pizza ordered over the span of a year.
·       As per given data we can conclude that average pizza quantity per order is somewhere close to 3.
·       Sunday being the day of lowest collections, one of the prime reason for which is a significant drop in orders during lunch hours(12:00 to 02:00) which is peak period for PLATO’s during other days. One can make an assumption based on above point is that PLATO’s good chunk of orders comes from institutions which are closed on Sunday and that is why there is a big drop in orders during lunch hours on Sunday.

# Optimization of seating capacity
Now we have 15 bench and 60 chairs making a combo of 1 bench-4 chairs, which in turn means 15 orders max at any given point of time.
Average pizza quantity ordered(Quantity of pizza) is 20+ /hour  i.e. at any given point of time we can expect at-least 20 people to be in the premises but during peak hours it can go as high as 60.
From above point we can conclude we have enough number of chairs to manage the footfall but as we know average pizza count/order is 3 which means we can serve 20 orders as per our chair capacity but the benches are only 15.
Additional 5 benches would really help to serve more orders/hour.
